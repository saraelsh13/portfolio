title: "AI Governance Docs for Enterprise Platforms"
---

## Context

Enterprise AI governance platform with multiple products and deployment models.
Docs scattered across tools, teams, and channels.
Users. data scientists, compliance leads, platform admins, executives.

## Problem

- Hard to find authoritative guidance for configuring, monitoring, and explaining models
- Inconsistent terminology for risks, metrics, and roles
- No clear narrative connecting UI, APIs, and policies

## What I did

1. Mapped the ecosystem.
   Audited existing docs, UI text, support tickets, and regulatory asks.
2. Defined a shared language.
   Glossary, role definitions, and reusable patterns for risks and metrics.
3. Designed a new information architecture.
   Tasks grouped by real workflows, not org charts or features.
4. Created reusable content components.
   Templates for evaluations, alerts, disclaimers, and guidance on interpreting results.
5. Set up governance.
   Guidelines, contribution rules, and review flows across product teams.

## Impact

- Faster pathways for key tasks such as onboarding, configuring monitors, and reading reports
- Clearer, more consistent messaging for model risk and limitations
- A content foundation that can power UI, docs, and AI assistants from the same source
