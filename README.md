# Hi, I’m Sara Elsharawy  
**Staff Content Designer | AI Documentation Architect | UX Systems Thinker**

I design and document the invisible systems that make AI understandable, governable, and human-centric.  
My work bridges engineering precision with editorial clarity—translating complex LLM, data, and API ecosystems into content models that scale trust and comprehension.

---

### What I Do
- **AI Platform Documentation:** Lead content systems for enterprise AI platforms including Watsonx.governance, OpenScale, and Cloud Pak for Data SaaS.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** Design end-to-end documentation workflows for APIs, automation, and governance tools, using Markdown, Git, and static site generators.
- **Ethical AI Communication:** Build frameworks that clarify model risk, explainability, and bias auditing for product teams and enterprise users.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Work alongside engineers, researchers, and product managers to unify technical accuracy with UX empathy.

---

### How I Work
- I treat **documentation as design for thought**—a structured narrative system that mirrors software architecture.  
- I use **content modeling and information architecture** principles to ensure docs are consistent, navigable, and trustworthy.  
- I maintain strong documentation pipelines with **Playwright freshness tests, reusable templates, and Git-based review flows**.

### Recent Highlights
- Led IBM’s AI ContentOps initiative for Watsonx.governance and OpenScale documentation refresh (v5.2), improving discoverability and accuracy.  
- Co-authored the **Natural Language Interfaces Workshop (CASCON 2024)**, exploring ethical content design for generative AI systems.  
- Awarded **IBM Content Champion (Q3 2024)** for building scalable doc architectures and mentoring cross-disciplinary teams.  
- Presented at **WeaveSphere 2022** on designing clarity for AI systems through content frameworks and UX research.

### Current Focus
- **AI Agents Documentation:** Exploring how to document agent orchestration, secure workflow automation, and multi-connector integrations (MCP, REST, GraphQL).  
- **Human–AI Interaction Design:** Researching ethical UX and affective computing approaches for enterprise LLM adoption.  
- **Portfolio Projects:**  
  - `wx-governance-docs` → AI model explainability guides (structured taxonomy + metadata schemas).  
  - `ethical-prompts-lab` → Research on prompt engineering, bias reporting, and AI literacy models.  
  - `north-docs-sample` → Prototype documentation architecture inspired by Cohere’s “North” platform.

### Philosophy
> “Documentation is infrastructure for understanding.”  
> My goal is to design doc systems that scale comprehension as efficiently as code scales capability.
