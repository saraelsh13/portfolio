## About Sara

I work at the intersection of AI products, documentation systems, and UX content.
My background spans media, UX research, AI governance content, and complex B2B platforms.

I like difficult products.
Model governance dashboards, data platforms, workflows that cross teams and regulations.
My job is to make them legible, safe, and trustworthy.

**Strengths**

- Systems thinker.
  I map messy ecosystems into navigable content models and patterns.
- Technical collaborator.
  Comfortable in Git, Markdown, API and workflow docs, and design systems.
- Ethically opinionated.
  I design for clarity about risk, limitations, and impact, not just conversion.

This portfolio is a working example of how I structure information for AI native teams.
