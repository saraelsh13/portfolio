## About Sara

I work at the intersection of AI products, documentation systems, and UX content.
My background spans media, UX research, AI governance content, and complex B2B platforms.

I like difficult products.
Model governance dashboards, data platforms, workflows that cross teams and regulations.
My job is to make them understandable, simple, and trustworthy.

**Strengths**

- Systems thinker.
  I map messy ecosystems into navigable content models and patterns.
- Technical collaborator.
  Comfortable in Git, Markdown, API and workflow docs, and design systems.
- Ethically opinionated.
  I design for clarity about risk, limitations, and impact, not just conversion.
- Collaborative Systems Designer.
I build internal partnerships between design, engineering, and content to establish repeatable frameworks for high-quality, scalable documentation systems.

This portfolio serves as a working example of how I structure information for AI-native teams.
