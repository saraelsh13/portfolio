## How I design systems behind the words

This page is here for teams who care how content scales, not just how it sounds.

### Content operations for AI products

- Source of truth models for concepts, entities, and terminology
- Contribution models so PMs and engineers can update safely
- Review workflows for safety, legal, and brand

### Prompt and response design

- Structured prompt templates with slots for user context, guardrails, and citations
- Response patterns that stay faithful to policies and product constraints
- Evaluation criteria, for example, accuracy, disclaimers, bias checks, and UX fit

### Documentation and knowledge for LLMs

- Taxonomies for feeding product docs into RAG and search
- Strategies to keep content retrieval friendly, up to date, and auditable
- Experiments in making system behaviour legible for users and stakeholders

You can explore specific frameworks and examples in my case studies under **Work**.
